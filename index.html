        <p class="review">Naruto is one of the best animes of all time, and this is a generally accepted fact. Right from the story building, to
          the character development, to the overall plot progression. It also poses one of the most anticipated villain organizations, the Akatsuki.
          The Akatsuki consists of different characters from different clans with different backstories with different powers and abilities. Pain
          is my favourite character because of his wisdom and the way his character was portrayed, along with the shroud of mystery he was initially
          covered in, which slowly disappeared as the story further progressed.

        <p class="review">One piece is my favourite anime of all time. I cant possibly hope to complete writing all the reasons i feel this way, but 
          the few points I will mention is its perfect plot, characters, camaraderie, world building, protagonists, antagonists, the list goes on.
          The whole concept of Devil fruits is also just absolutely superb. Haki is a perfect compliment to the foundational power system of the anime
          as well.
